4.1 Understanding the Organization and Its Context

CyTech Secure Solutions Ltd. is a small-to-medium enterprise (SME) providing cybersecurity, risk management, and IT infrastructure services to small businesses and public-sector organizations. The company operates in an increasingly complex regulatory and threat environment where confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information are critical to client trust and service continuity.

To ensure a complete understanding of factors that influence the ISMS, I will conduct both SWOT and PESTLE analyses.                                                                                                                                                                         🔹 SWOT Analysis (Internal & External Context)                                                    | **Factor**        | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                            |
