# ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Information Security Management System (ISMS) Implementation Project  

### 📘 Project Overview  
This project represents a full-scale, simulated **implementation of ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Information Security Management System (ISMS)**.  
It is led by **Cypriano Akinwunmi (GRC – Cybersecurity Risk & Compliance Professional)** using a **Kali Linux virtual environment** to demonstrate hands-on competence in documentation, configuration, control implementation, and continuous improvement — aligned with the clauses of ISO/IEC 27001:2022.  

All tasks in this project will be structured along the ISO 27001:2022 Clauses:  
- Clause 4 – Context of the Organization  
- Clause 5 – Leadership  
- Clause 6 – Planning  
- Clause 7 – Support  
- Clause 8 – Operation  
- Clause 9 – Performance Evaluation  
- Clause 10 – Improvement

## 🎯 Objective  
To simulate and document the step-by-step implementation of an ISO/IEC 27001:2022–compliant Information Security Management System (ISMS) within an organizational environment, showcasing professional ability to:  
- Interpret and apply each clause in practice.  
- Identify and manage information security risks.  
- Develop policies, procedures, and controls aligned with Annex A.  
- Demonstrate continual improvement using audit findings and corrective actions.

## 🔍 Clause-by-Clause Implementation Plan  

### **Clause 4 – Context of the Organization**  
I will define the internal and external context influencing information security objectives through SWOT and PESTLE analysis.  
I will identify stakeholders, their needs, and expectations, and define the ISMS scope boundaries in a formal document:  
`/01_Context/ISMS_Context_and_Scope_Statement.docx`.

### **Clause 5 – Leadership**  
I will develop and publish the organization’s **Information Security Policy**, secure top management approval, and define clear roles and responsibilities through a **RACI matrix**.  
Evidence of management endorsement will be stored in `/02_Leadership/`.

### **Clause 6 – Planning**  
I will conduct an ISO 27005–aligned **risk assessment**, document identified threats and vulnerabilities, and formulate a **risk treatment plan** using Annex A controls.  
All risk documents will be located in `/03_Planning/`.

### **Clause 7 – Support**  
I will establish ISMS resources, training plans, awareness campaigns, and secure documentation procedures.  
Training and communication records will be managed in `/04_Support/`.

### **Clause 8 – Operation**  
I will implement operational controls, simulate incidents, and manage them using an **Incident Response Plan**.  
Operational records will reside in `/05_Operation/`.

### **Clause 9 – Performance Evaluation**  
I will create Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), conduct internal audits, and perform management reviews.  
Performance evidence and audit records will be stored in `/06_Performance_Evaluation/`.

### **Clause 10 – Improvement**  
I will identify nonconformities, analyze root causes, and implement corrective actions for continual improvement.  
Improvement records will be kept in `/07_Improvement/`.

## 🧾 Documentation and Evidence Collection  
All compliance evidence — including screenshots from the Kali Linux VM, Git commit logs, policies, and audit documents — will be organized in the `Evidence/` and `Screenshots/` directories.  
Version control will be maintained via GitHub commits to demonstrate traceability and accountability.

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Environment  
- **Operating System:** Kali Linux VM  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  
- **Documentation Tools:** LibreOffice, VS Code, and Markdown  
- **Standards Framework:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 & ISO/IEC 27005  
- **Audit & Assessment:** Manual evaluation and simulated scenarios  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps  
1. Continue populating clause-based documentation folders with real policy, risk, and control examples.  
2. Capture and upload screenshots of each completed activity.  
3. Perform internal audit simulations and generate a final **ISMS Implementation Report** in PDF format.
