# ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Information Security Management System (ISMS) Implementation Project  

### 🏢 Organization Overview  
The simulated ISMS implementation is designed for **CyTech Secure Solutions Ltd.**,  
a small-to-medium enterprise (SME) specializing in cybersecurity, IT infrastructure management, and data protection services.  
The company handles sensitive client data, conducts vulnerability assessments, and manages endpoint and network security for several business clients across multiple sectors.  
The purpose of this project is to strengthen **CyTech’s information security posture** and achieve compliance with **ISO/IEC 27001:2022** by establishing a robust, risk-based Information Security Management System (ISMS).  

---

### 📘 Project Overview  
This project represents a full-scale, simulated **implementation of ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Information Security Management System (ISMS)**.  
It is led by **Cypriano Akinwunmi (GRC – Cybersecurity Risk & Compliance Professional)** using a **Kali Linux virtual environment** to demonstrate professional competence in planning, implementing, operating, and evaluating ISMS processes according to the standard’s requirements.  

All activities in this project will be structured along the ISO 27001:2022 Clauses:  
- Clause 4 – Context of the Organization  
- Clause 5 – Leadership  
- Clause 6 – Planning  
- Clause 7 – Support  
- Clause 8 – Operation  
- Clause 9 – Performance Evaluation  
- Clause 10 – Improvement  

---

## 🎯 Objective  
To simulate and document the comprehensive implementation of an ISO/IEC 27001:2022–compliant Information Security Management System (ISMS) within **CyTech Secure Solutions Ltd.**, demonstrating the ability to:  
- Translate ISO 27001 requirements into actionable processes.  
- Identify and assess information security risks.  
- Develop and implement appropriate controls based on Annex A.  
- Establish continuous improvement mechanisms through audits and management reviews.  
- Showcase documentation and compliance evidence professionally via Git and GitHub.

## 🔍 Clause-by-Clause Implementation Plan  

### **Clause 4 – Context of the Organization**  
I will analyze CyTech’s internal and external context using **SWOT** and **PESTLE** frameworks to understand the factors influencing its ISMS objectives.  
Stakeholders such as clients, regulators, employees, and service providers will be identified, along with their information security expectations.  
The ISMS scope statement will define the systems, services, and departments covered under certification.  
All context documentation will be maintained in `/01_Context/`.

### **Clause 5 – Leadership**  
I will develop and publish the organization’s **Information Security Policy**, secure top management approval, and define ISMS roles and responsibilities through a **RACI matrix**.  
Simulated evidence of management commitment (such as digital approval and endorsement letters) will be stored in `/02_Leadership/`.

### **Clause 6 – Planning**  
I will perform a detailed **risk assessment** following ISO 27005 methodology, identifying threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts to CyTech’s assets.  
A **risk treatment plan** will be developed by mapping relevant **Annex A controls** to identified risks.  
All risk analysis records and treatment actions will be located in `/03_Planning/`.

### **Clause 7 – Support**  
I will ensure the provision of adequate resources, staff competence, and ISMS awareness programs.  
A **Training and Awareness Plan** will outline periodic security awareness sessions, role-based training, and communication procedures.  
All support documentation will reside in `/04_Support/`.

### **Clause 8 – Operation**  
I will implement operational risk treatment actions, document standard operating procedures, and simulate incident response scenarios (e.g., unauthorized access, phishing attempt).  
Incident handling logs and evidence of operational controls will be stored in `/05_Operation/`.

### **Clause 9 – Performance Evaluation**  
I will monitor ISMS performance using defined **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**, conduct **internal ISMS audits**, and simulate **management review meetings** to evaluate effectiveness.  
Evaluation records, audit reports, and review minutes will be maintained in `/06_Performance_Evaluation/`.

### **Clause 10 – Improvement**  
I will record nonconformities identified during audits, perform root cause analysis using the **5 Whys** technique, and implement corrective actions.  
All continual improvement records will be stored in `/07_Improvement/`.

## 🧾 Documentation and Evidence Collection  
All compliance evidence — including screenshots from the Kali Linux VM, Git commit logs, and supporting documents — will be organized within the `Evidence/` and `Screenshots/` directories.  
This approach ensures verifiable traceability and accountability in line with ISO 27001 documentation requirements.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Environment  
- **Operating System:** Kali Linux VM  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  
- **Documentation Tools:** LibreOffice, VS Code, and Markdown  
- **Frameworks Referenced:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022, ISO/IEC 27005  
- **Audit Simulation:** Manual internal audit and management review exercises  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps  
1. Populate clause folders with live documentation, reports, and screenshots.  
2. Upload the **ISMS Context and Scope Statement** and **Information Security Policy** as initial deliverables.  
3. Simulate and document CyTech’s internal audit process for ISO 27001 compliance verification.  
4. Produce a comprehensive final **ISMS Implementation Report (PDF)** for presentation.
